# Surplus-Tracker
by Aretha Fontaine and Harika Vemulapalli

The main goal of this software is to manage/track the disposal process of equipment/devices at Midwestern State University. Currently at the I.T. department, the surplus process is entirely maual, involving an array of chunky paperwork then drop-off to the university's warehouse where warehouse workers then also manually check the paperwork to ensure that all equipment is accounted for.    

With our system in place, the need for manual checking would be reduced to a simple barcode scan. Surplus tracker would retrieve the metadata of every device on campus, and collaborate with existing inventory systems in place to recommend surplus timelines. Every transaction will be thoroughly logged, to minimize the risk of unauthorized disposal and lack of accountability.
